23-12-2025:
1. authController: 
    
    Problems:
    - Missing return statements after sending error responses causes code to continue execution leading to multiple responses or unexpected behavior
    - Inconsistent response format across API - need standardized format for all success/error responses throughout backend for better frontend handling
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Email format validation - Not checking valid email pattern
    ❌ Password strength validation - No minimum length or complexity check
    
    Changes made:
    - authController.js: Added return statements in registerUser, changed token response format in loginUser to {token}, standardized error responses to {error: "..."} format, implemented resetPassword function, added email validation regex, added password minimum length check (6 characters)

2. expenseController:
    
    Problems:
    - Inconsistent response format using {"message":"..."} instead of {error:"..."}
    - Unnecessary console.log statements in code
    - Quoted object keys for responses
    - Missing const declaration for addExpense function
    - Wrong field name in Budget query - line 36 used Budget.findOne({user:...}) but Budget model has userId field causing query to fail
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Merchant field in Expense model - User Story 5 requires viewing expenses by merchant
    ❌ GET all expenses endpoint - No way to fetch and list all user expenses with filters
    ❌ GET single expense by ID - Cannot view specific expense details
    ❌ UPDATE expense endpoint - Users cannot edit/correct expense entries
    ❌ DELETE expense endpoint - No way to remove incorrect expenses
    ❌ Filter expenses by category, date range, merchant - Required by User Story 5
    
    Changes made:
    - expenseController.js: Changed error response from {"message":"..."} to {error:"..."}, removed console.log statements, removed quotes from response object keys, added const declaration to addExpense, added merchant field support in addExpense()
    - expenseController.js: Fixed Budget.findOne query on line 36 from {user:req.user.id} to {userId:req.user.id} to match Budget model schema
    - expenseController.js: Implemented getExpenses() with filtering by category/date/merchant, getExpenseById() to fetch single expense, updateExpense() to edit expense, deleteExpense() to remove expense
    - Expense.js model: Added optional merchant field (String type) to support User Story 5 requirement of viewing by merchant
    - expenseRoutes.js: Added GET /, GET /:id, PUT /:id, DELETE /:id routes with authentication for complete CRUD operations
    
    Result: Full CRUD operations now available. Users can add, view (with filters), edit, and delete expenses. Merchant tracking enabled for better expense categorization. Budget alert functionality now working correctly.
    
    TESTING UPDATE (23-12-2025):
    ❌ BUG FOUND: MongoDB aggregate query in addExpense() was missing _id field in $group stage, causing aggregate operation to fail
    ✅ FIX APPLIED: Added _id: null to $group stage on line 31 - Budget alert calculation now working properly
    ✅ TESTED: All expense endpoints verified working - add, get all, get by id, update, delete, filters (category/date/merchant)

3. budgetController:
    
    Problems:
    - Budget controller was missing userId field in both finding and creating budgets, causing budgets to not be user-specific
    - Quoted object keys for responses
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Get all budgets endpoint - No way to fetch and display user's existing budgets
    ❌ Get single budget by category - Cannot view specific budget details
    ❌ Delete budget endpoint - No way to remove budgets
    ❌ Budget Planner feature - User Story 7 requires planning future expenses with budget planner
    ❌ Past spending analysis for budget recommendations
    
    Changes made:
    - budgetController.js: Added userId to Budget.findOne() query and Budget.create() object, added getBudgets() to fetch all user budgets, getBudgetByCategory() to get specific budget, deleteBudget() to remove budget, removed quotes from response object keys
    - budgetController.js: Implemented getBudgetPlanner() to analyze past 3 months spending, calculate monthly averages, project future expenses, and provide budget recommendations with adequate/insufficient status
    - Budget.js model: Added userId field with ObjectId reference to User collection
    - budgetRoutes.js: Added GET /budgets, GET /budgets/planner, GET /budgets/:category, DELETE /budgets/:category routes, removed console.log statements
    
    Result: Complete budget management with CRUD operations. Budget planner analyzes past spending patterns and provides intelligent recommendations for future budget planning.

4. dashboardController:
    
    Problems:
    - Incomplete code - Function is not finished
    - Variable scope error - exp is used outside forEach loop
    - Missing logic - expensesByMonth is declared but never used
    - No response sent - Function doesn't return any data
    - Empty catch block - No error handling
    - Wrong userId field - Should be req.user.id not req.user.userId
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Expenses by date/month - Declared but not implemented
    ❌ Recent expenses list - Not implemented
    ❌ Budget vs actual spending comparison - Not implemented
    ❌ Data for graphs/charts visualization - Not implemented
    ❌ Filter dashboard by category, date range, merchant - User Story 5 requires viewing by category/date/merchant
    
    Changes made:
    - dashboardController.js: Fixed variable scope error, corrected userId to req.user.id, implemented complete getSummary function with totalExpenses, expensesByCategory, expensesByMonth (last 6 months), recentExpenses (last 10), budgetComparison, and statistics for visualization
    - dashboardController.js: Added query parameter filtering support for category, startDate, endDate, and merchant to enable filtered dashboard views as per User Story 5
    - dashboardRoutes.js: Added GET /summary route with authentication (file was completely empty before)
    
    Result: Complete dashboard with visualization data and filtering capabilities. Users can now view expenses by category, date range, and merchant as required by project description.

5. exportController:
    
    Problems:
    - File is completely empty - No implementation
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Export to Excel functionality - User Story 6 requires Excel export
    ❌ Export to PDF functionality - User Story 6 requires PDF export
    ❌ Export endpoints not created
    
    Changes made:
    - exportController.js: Implemented exportToExcel() and exportToPDF() functions to export user expense data
    - exportRoutes.js: Added GET /export/excel and GET /export/pdf routes with authentication
    - package.json: Added exceljs and pdfkit packages for export functionality

6. importController:
    
    Problems:
    - File is completely empty - No implementation
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Bank account import functionality - User Story 3 requires importing expenses from bank
    ❌ Auto-categorization of imported expenses
    
    Changes made:
    - importController.js: Implemented importFromBank() to import transactions from bank CSV/JSON with auto-categorization
    - importRoutes.js: Added POST /import/bank route with authentication
    - categorize.js utility: Need to implement auto-categorization logic

7. goalController (merged with reportController):
    
    Problems:
    - Files were completely empty - No implementation
    - User Story 7 has both Goals AND Reports - should be in one controller
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Financial goals creation and tracking - User Story 7
    ❌ Custom reports with spending insights - User Story 7
    ❌ Category reports, time-based reports, spending trends
    
    Changes made:
    - goalController.js: Implemented createGoal(), getGoals(), updateGoalProgress(), deleteGoal() for goals management, and getCategoryReport(), getTimeBasedReport(), getSpendingTrends() for custom reports
    - goalRoutes.js: Added goal routes (POST /, GET /, PUT /:goalId/progress, DELETE /:goalId) and report routes (GET /reports/category, GET /reports/time, GET /reports/trends)
    - Goal.js model: Added userId and current_amount fields
    - reportController.js & reportRoutes.js: Deprecated and merged into goalController
    - app.js: Removed reportRoute, added importRoute and goalRoute

8. Model Files (DATABASE SCHEMA):
    
    Problems:
    - Typo in 3 model files: "moongoose" instead of "mongoose" causing runtime errors
    - Expense.js: userId field was commented out, breaking user-expense relationship
    - Goal.js fixed the target_amount to number for calculations
    - Inconsistency: Only Budget.js was correct
    
    Security Issues:
    ❌ Missing user field in Expense model - expenses not linked to users (CRITICAL)
    ❌ All users could potentially see each other's expenses
    
    Changes made:
    - User.js: Fixed typo "moongoose" → "mongoose"
    - Expense.js: Fixed typo "moongoose" → "mongoose", uncommented and renamed userId field to "user" to match controller usage (user: ObjectId ref to User model)
    - Goal.js: Fixed typo "moongoose" → "mongoose" &  (target_amount correctly set as Number type)
    - Budget.js: No changes needed - already correct
    
    Result: All models now properly use mongoose, have correct field types, and maintain proper user relationships for data security and integrity
9. Route Files (API ENDPOINTS):
    
    Problems:
    - dashboardRoutes.js was completely empty - Dashboard API endpoint not accessible despite controller being fully implemented
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Dashboard route not defined - GET /summary endpoint missing
    
    Changes made:
    - dashboardRoutes.js: Implemented complete route file with GET /summary endpoint and authentication middleware
    - expenseRoutes.js: Cleaned up commented console.log statements
    - All other route files (authRoutes.js, budgetRoutes.js, exportRoutes.js, importRoutes.js, goalRoutes.js) were already correctly implemented with proper authentication middleware
10. Utility Files (HELPER FUNCTIONS & MIDDLEWARE):
    
    Problems:
    - authMiddleware.js had 3 critical bugs: missing const declaration (creating global variable), wrong req.user structure (string instead of object causing req.user.id to fail), inconsistent response format using "message" instead of "error"
    - categorize.js was completely empty - auto-categorization for bank imports not working
    - errorMiddleware.js empty but not critical for basic functionality
    - excelExport.js & pdfExport.js empty but export logic already in exportController (files redundant)
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Auto-categorization logic for imported transactions - User Story 3 requires automatic expense categorization
    ❌ Keyword-based mapping for Food, Travel, Shopping, Bills, Other categories
    ❌ Global error handling middleware for consistent error responses
    
    Changes made:
    - authMiddleware.js: Added const declaration to protect function, fixed req.user structure from string to object {id: decoded.id} so controllers can access req.user.id properly, standardized error responses from {message:"..."} to {error:"..."} format
    - categorize.js: Implemented simple keyword-based auto-categorization function that maps transaction descriptions to categories (Food: restaurant/grocery/zomato/swiggy, Travel: uber/ola/taxi/fuel, Shopping: amazon/flipkart/mall, Bills: electric/rent/mobile/subscription, Other: default)
    - db.js: No changes needed - already working correctly
    Removed files : 
    - errorMiddleware.js: Left empty (optional - not required for core functionality)
    - excelExport.js & pdfExport.js: Left empty (redundant files - logic already in exportController)
    
    Result: Authentication middleware now works correctly with proper req.user object structure and consistent error formatting. Bank import auto-categorization now functional with simple keyword matching logic.

11. npm packages installation error:
    Error: E401 "Incorrect or missing password" - npm authentication token issue with stored credentials in system - Resolved by using yarn package manager instead of npm which successfully installed all dependencies (bcryptjs, cors, dotenv, exceljs, express, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, nodemon, pdfkit)

25-12-2025:
12. Authentication Security - Migrated to Cookie-Based Auth:
    
    Problem:
    - Using localStorage for JWT tokens - vulnerable to XSS attacks
    - Token exposed to JavaScript - security risk
    - Manual token management in every request
    
    Changes made:
    Backend:
    - app.js: Added cookie-parser middleware, updated CORS with credentials: true
    - authController.js: Changed login/signup to set httpOnly cookies instead of returning token in response, added logoutUser() to clear cookie
    - authMiddleware.js: Modified to read token from req.cookies.token instead of Authorization header
    - authRoutes.js: Added POST /logout endpoint
    
    Frontend:
    - api.ts: Removed localStorage code (getToken, setToken, removeToken), added credentials: 'include' to all requests, removed Authorization headers
    - Navigation.tsx: Changed logout to call authAPI.logout() instead of removeToken()
    - Login.tsx: Removed setToken() call, cookie set automatically by backend
    - Signup.tsx: Changed to redirect to dashboard directly (cookie set on signup)
    
    Result: Tokens now stored in httpOnly cookies (protected from XSS), automatic cookie handling by browser, SameSite CSRF protection, secure flag for production HTTPS

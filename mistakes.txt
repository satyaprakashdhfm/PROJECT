23-12-2025:
1. authController: 
    
    Problems:
    - Missing return statements after sending error responses causes code to continue execution leading to multiple responses or unexpected behavior
    - Inconsistent response format across API - need standardized format for all success/error responses throughout backend for better frontend handling
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Email format validation - Not checking valid email pattern
    ❌ Password strength validation - No minimum length or complexity check
    
    Changes made:
    - authController.js: Added return statements in registerUser, changed token response format in loginUser to {token}, standardized error responses to {error: "..."} format, implemented resetPassword function, added email validation regex, added password minimum length check (6 characters)

2. expenseController:
    
    Problems:
    - Inconsistent response format using {"message":"..."} instead of {error:"..."}
    - Unnecessary console.log statements in code
    - Quoted object keys for responses
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    (None - basic functionality implemented)
    
    Changes made:
    - expenseController.js: Changed error response from {"message":"..."} to {error:"..."}, removed console.log statements, removed quotes from response object keys

3. budgetController:
    
    Problems:
    - Budget controller was missing userId field in both finding and creating budgets, causing budgets to not be user-specific
    - Quoted object keys for responses
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Get all budgets endpoint - No way to fetch and display user's existing budgets
    ❌ Get single budget by category - Cannot view specific budget details
    ❌ Delete budget endpoint - No way to remove budgets
    
    Changes made:
    - budgetController.js: Added userId to Budget.findOne() query and Budget.create() object, added getBudgets() to fetch all user budgets, getBudgetByCategory() to get specific budget, deleteBudget() to remove budget, removed quotes from response object keys
    - Budget.js model: Added userId field with ObjectId reference to User collection
    - budgetRoutes.js: Added GET /budgets, GET /budgets/:category, DELETE /budgets/:category routes, removed console.log statements

4. dashboardController:
    
    Problems:
    - Incomplete code - Function is not finished
    - Variable scope error - exp is used outside forEach loop
    - Missing logic - expensesByMonth is declared but never used
    - No response sent - Function doesn't return any data
    - Empty catch block - No error handling
    - Wrong userId field - Should be req.user.id not req.user.userId
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Expenses by date/month - Declared but not implemented
    ❌ Recent expenses list - Not implemented
    ❌ Budget vs actual spending comparison - Not implemented

5. exportController:
    
    Problems:
    - File is completely empty - No implementation
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Export to Excel functionality - User Story 6 requires Excel export
    ❌ Export to PDF functionality - User Story 6 requires PDF export
    ❌ Export endpoints not created
    
    Changes made:
    - exportController.js: Implemented exportToExcel() and exportToPDF() functions to export user expense data
    - exportRoutes.js: Added GET /export/excel and GET /export/pdf routes with authentication
    - package.json: Added exceljs and pdfkit packages for export functionality

6. importController:
    
    Problems:
    - File is completely empty - No implementation
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Bank account import functionality - User Story 3 requires importing expenses from bank
    ❌ Auto-categorization of imported expenses
    
    Changes made:
    - importController.js: Implemented importFromBank() to import transactions from bank CSV/JSON with auto-categorization
    - importRoutes.js: Added POST /import/bank route with authentication
    - categorize.js utility: Need to implement auto-categorization logic

7. goalController (merged with reportController):
    
    Problems:
    - Files were completely empty - No implementation
    - User Story 7 has both Goals AND Reports - should be in one controller
    
    Missing from Problem Statement:
    ❌ Financial goals creation and tracking - User Story 7
    ❌ Custom reports with spending insights - User Story 7
    ❌ Category reports, time-based reports, spending trends
    
    Changes made:
    - goalController.js: Implemented createGoal(), getGoals(), updateGoalProgress(), deleteGoal() for goals management, and getCategoryReport(), getTimeBasedReport(), getSpendingTrends() for custom reports
    - goalRoutes.js: Added goal routes (POST /, GET /, PUT /:goalId/progress, DELETE /:goalId) and report routes (GET /reports/category, GET /reports/time, GET /reports/trends)
